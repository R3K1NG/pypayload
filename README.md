# pypayload
Simple Automatic Metasploit Payload Generator

## Introduction

__Metasploit__ is a great suite for penetration testing. However, I tend to find it a hassle to create a payload utilizing Metasploit's __msfvenom__, and created this project in order to automate that process.


## Dependencies

* Metasploit
* Python 2.7.x
* Git

## Download & Installation

Get the repository off of Github by cloning it:

    $ git clone https://github.com/R3K1NG/pypayload

Change into the pypayload directory:

    $ cd /path/to/pypayload

Execute with python:

    $ python pypayload.py

The generated payload will be in the same directory as pypayload.
